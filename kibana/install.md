# ES install

In this lab we will practice the installation of Kibana.


Lab Goals:

* Install Solr and verify its operation
* Prepare to use this install for all subsequent labs

### STEP 1: Login to the server
 
Each student is provided their individual server and credentials

(Instructor: use our ubuntu AMI, t2.large or t2.xlarge instances and Elasticsearch security group)

### STEP 2: Prepare the environment

Verify that you have Java installed 

    java -version
    
Get the elastic-labs
    
    git clone git@github.com:elephantscale/elastic-labs.git    

### STEP 3: Download and install ES

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/elephantscale-public/downloads/elasticsearch-5.5.3.zip    
    unzip elasticsearch-5.5.3.zip
    rm -fr elasticsearch
    mv elasticsearch-5.5.3 elasticsearch

If you want to experiment with Elasticsearch 6
    
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/elephantscale-public/downloads/elasticsearch-6.0.0.zip
        
### STEP 4: Start ES

    cd elasticsearch
    bin/elasticsearch 
    
_Tip_: You can run it in the background as a daemon by using the -d option

    Try this
    
    bin/elasticsearch -d
    
### STEP 5: Verify install

    curl 'http://localhost:9200/?pretty'
    
You should see an output like this

    {
      "name" : "gulBgf7",
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
      "cluster_uuid" : "fMqo6fq-SfqRwRCOKqrq9Q",
      "version" : {
        "number" : "6.0.0",
        "build_hash" : "8f0685b",
        "build_date" : "2017-11-10T18:41:22.859Z",
        "build_snapshot" : false,
        "lucene_version" : "7.0.1",
        "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
        "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
      },
      "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
    }

### STEP 6: Examine the logs.

The logs are found in the `logs` directory. Open the logs for examination

    nano logs/elasticsearch.log
    
or

    vi logs/elasticsearch.log
            
We have saved our logs [here](elasticsearch.log). You can use these if you cannot access
your logs.
 
Letâ€™s take a look at some of those lines and what they mean.
The first line typically provides statistics about the node you started:

* Find your node name (it is random, but you can modify it in the configuration
* Find boung URL and port
* Find plugins
* Port 9300 is used by default for inter-node communication, called transport. Find this in the logs
* Port 9200 is used for HTTP communication by default. This is where applications
  using the REST API connect. Find it in the logs.

### STEP 7: Test the REST API in the browser

For this, you will need the Desktop UI, which the instructor will provide.

It should like like this image

## Additional advice

### Configuration parameters

    config/elasticsearch.yml

### Environment Variables

* The JAVA_OPTS passed to JVM is used by Elasticsearch

### Configuration files

    elasticsearch.yml

Configure different Elasticsearch modules.

    logging.yml
    
Configure the Elasticsearch logging
    
### STEP 8) ES options

    bin/elasticsearch 
or
    bin/elasticsearch --help
    
Study the options
